# Starter-Project
This is the starter project for the Full Stack Web group projects.  

## Organization
This project is broken into separate folders of API, UI, and DB.  These folders are for the 3 different layers of a full stack web application.  API for the back end, UI for the front end, and DB for the database.  

Within each of those folders are subfolders indicating a platform for that layer.  

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you should first fork this repository to your own Github Organizataion or personal account.  From there, simply remove the subfolders of the respective platforms you will not be using for your project.  

## Independent But The Same
Each platform under the different layers will offer the same functionality as the other platforms of the same layer.  So the code for Java, C#, and Javascript will all offer the same API endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE actions.  The React and Angular code will provide the same visual representation of the pages.  

## Broken
Throughout the code there will be a variety of bugs that you must fix in order to make the application work.  You will first need to fix these coding bugs in order to add additional features to the application.
